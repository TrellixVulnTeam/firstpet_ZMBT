      <h4>Origins</h4>
      <p>
        We work hard to ensure that the fruit and vegetables we sell are fresh
        and high in quality. If we donâ€™t grow them ourselves, we source them
        from carefully chosen suppliers, preferring to buy locally whenever
        possible.
      </p>
      <h4>How to cook</h4>
      <p>
        From roasts, salads and soups to casseroles and cakes, Carrots will lend
        sweetness, texture and colour to an enormous number of recipes.
